## What is NINJAM?

NINJAM (Novel Intervallic Network Jamming Architecture for Music) allows musicians to jam together over the internet in real-time. Unlike traditional approaches that try to minimize latency, NINJAM embraces it by using a time-synchronized approach where everyone plays along with what was recorded in the previous interval. This creates a unique collaborative experience where musicians can perform together regardless of geographic location.

## About This Plugin

This project ports the NINJAM client functionality into a cross-platform CLAP audio plugin, allowing you to:

- **Use NINJAM directly in your DAW** — Connect to jam sessions without leaving your production environment
- **Route audio flexibly** — Use your DAW's mixer for monitoring and processing
- **Record sessions natively** — Capture everything directly in your DAW's timeline
- **Apply effects** — Process incoming audio from other musicians with your favorite plugins

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Connect to any NINJAM server
- Real-time audio streaming with OGG/Vorbis encoding
- Automatic BPM/BPI synchronization with the server
- Local channel management
- View connected users and their channels

### Audio
- Stereo input/output (expandable in future versions)
- Master volume control with soft clipping
- Per-channel gain adjustment
- Configurable audio quality

### User Interface
- Modern ImGui-based interface
- Native look and feel (Metal on macOS, D3D11 on Windows)
- Connection panel with server browser
- Real-time status display
- User/channel visualization

## Supported Hosts

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mkschulze/ninjam-clap.git
cd ninjam-clap

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure (macOS) - Dev build with verbose logging
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNINJAM_CLAP_DEV_BUILD=ON

# Configure (macOS) - Production build with minimal logging  
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNINJAM_CLAP_DEV_BUILD=OFF

# Configure (Windows with Visual Studio)
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Quick Install (macOS)

```bash
# Build and install to ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/
./install.sh
```

### Output

- **macOS**: `build/NINJAM.clap` (bundle)
- **Windows**: `build/Release/NINJAM.clap` (DLL)

## Installation

### macOS
Copy `NINJAM.clap` to one of:
- `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/` (user)
- `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/` (system-wide)

### Windows
Copy `NINJAM.clap` to one of:
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\CLAP\` (user)
- `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP\` (system-wide)

## Usage

1. Load the NINJAM plugin on a track in your DAW
2. Open the plugin GUI
3. Enter a server address (e.g., `ninbot.com:2049`) or select from the list
4. Enter your username and optional password
5. Click **Connect**
6. Route audio to the plugin's input for your local channel
7. The plugin output contains the mixed audio from all participants

### Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Master Volume | 0.0 – 1.0 | Overall output level |
| Metronome Volume | 0.0 – 1.0 | Click track level |
| Metronome Pan | -1.0 – 1.0 | Click track stereo position |
| Monitor Input | On/Off | Hear your own input |
| Connected | On/Off | Connection state |

```

### Threading Model

The plugin uses a command queue architecture for thread safety:

- **UI Thread** - Renders ImGui, sends commands to run thread
- **Run Thread** - Processes NJClient, handles network I/O
- **Audio Thread** - Calls AudioProc() for sample processing

Communication is lock-free via SPSC ring buffers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)

### UI ID Check

To avoid Dear ImGui ID collisions, run the local checker:

```bash
python3 tools/check_imgui_ids.py
```

It flags unscoped widget labels that are not wrapped in `ImGui::PushID(...)`.
5. Open a Pull Request
