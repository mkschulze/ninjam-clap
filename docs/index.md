## How NINJAM Works

Unlike traditional low-latency approaches, NINJAM embraces internet delay creatively:

1. **Everyone hears the previous interval** — You play along with what others recorded in the last cycle
2. **Time-synchronized jamming** — The server keeps everyone in sync with a shared BPM/BPI
3. **Creative collaboration** — The delayed approach creates unique musical possibilities

This means you can jam with someone across the world with the same experience as someone across town.
